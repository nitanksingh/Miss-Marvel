    <h1>I am Sorry, My Marvel Stree üå∏</h1>
    <p class="message">
      My beautiful stree, whenever I see you, I cannot help but think of Radha. You carry her grace, her charm, her strength,
      and that quiet magic which turns even the simplest of moments into something divine.
      I will never call myself Krishna, because I am not as good, not as perfect, not as divine as he was. But you, in every sense,
      are Radha to me. And just like her, you will always remain the most beautiful truth of my life.
      I know, deep inside, that no matter how much I share my feelings, they may never take us any further. Our story may not have
      that future I sometimes wish for. Yet that doesn't stop me from cherishing every moment in the present with you. Every smile
      of yours feels like Vrindavan, every glance like the song of a flute, and every conversation like a prayer answered.
      Maybe, one day, all my words will fade away unheard. But even then, I will carry the joy of knowing that in this lifetime,
      I got to walk beside my Radha, even if only for a while. And that is more than enough for me.
